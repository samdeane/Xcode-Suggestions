What's This?
============

I've been moaning about Xcode recently, but it's got lots of good stuff about it.

It's just that it's also got lots of annoying little glitches too. When you're forced to work with something every day, those glitches get somewhat grating.

So rather than be unremittingly negative, I thought I'd create a place for people to post positive suggestions about how to improve it.

The only rule is be constructive. This isn't for reporting bugs, as such. If you've got a suggestion about how to improve "broken" or incomplete behaviour though, go ahead. If there is an associated rdar: link, go ahead and include it.

See the [wiki](wiki) for more information.
